# CoLab-B project for IT1825 Web Development Project Module

This repository contains all the work for our Web Development Project.

## Progress & Setup

We have not started development yet.  
As we move forward, the frontend and backend files will be added into their folders.  
Any design drafts, planning documents or wireframes will be uploaded into the **docs** folder.

## Workflow

- Each member will work on their own branch once coding begins.  
- Commit changes regularly.  
- Open a pull request when a feature is ready for review.  
- I will review and merge everything into the main branch.

## Notes

The structure may be updated as the project grows.  
All planning files, drafts and documentation will be stored inside the **docs** folder.
